# Pointman
File identification tool for Linux, written in Python. Inspired by TrID. Designed to assist incident responders.

Pointman will guide you through the setup, including setting up a bash alias and installing dependencies. 

### Usage

1. Set up Pointman

`python3 /path/to/script/Pointman.py`

2. Use Pointman

`Pointman -f target_file -v`

Verbose mode is better than normal mode :)
